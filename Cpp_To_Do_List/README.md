# Overview


My To-Do List program, written in C++, provides a simple but intuitive interface to manage everyday tasks. Users can interact with a console application to add, remove, mark tasks as done, view all tasks, and even export the task list to a text file. The program utilized fundamental aspects of C++, such as classes, vectors, file I/O operations, and control structures. This software serves as a practical application of core programming concepts and is a great example of how C++ can be used to create a useful program.

The primary purpose behind creating this To-Do List program was to get accustomed to the syntax and other foreign aspects of C++. I have been programming in C# and Python for the past few years, so I wanted to challenge myself by learning a new language. I also wanted to create a program that I could use in my everyday life. I have always been a fan of to-do lists, so I thought it would be a great idea to create a program that would allow me to manage my tasks in a more efficient manner. I am very pleased with the outcome of this project and I am excited to continue learning C++.

# Development Environment

To develop the To-Do List software, I primarily used CLion as my IDE. CLion has a very user-friendly interface and provides an amazing environment to facilitate effective software development. The IDE also offers great features like intelligent code assistance and debugging capabilities. The ease of use and integrated tools provided by CLion allowed me to easily manage, write, and debug the code, enhancing my overall experience writing C++ code.

The programming language I employed for this project was C++. C++ is often regarded as one of the most powerful programming languages and is widely used in the software industry. While I am still a newbie in C++, I have learned a lot about the language and its capabilities through this project. It was a great experience to learn a new language and helped me gain a better understanding of the fundamentals of programming.
