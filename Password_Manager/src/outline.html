**1. Introduction to Rust**
- What is Rust?
    - A systems programming language that guarantees memory safety.
    - Performance and concurrency advantages.

**2. Basics of Variables and Data Types**
- Variables:
    - Immutable by default.
    - Use of `mut` keyword for mutable variables.
- Common Data Types:
    - Integers, floats, booleans, and characters.
- Strings:
    - Difference between `String` (owned string) and `str` (string slice).
    - Methods to manipulate and access strings.

**3. User Input and Output**
- `println!`:
    - How to print to the console.
    - Using `{}` to insert variables into print statements.
- Taking User Input:
    - The `std::io::stdin().read_line()` method.
    - Parsing and handling user input.

**4. Control Flow**
- Conditional Statements:
    - `if`, `else`, and `else if`.
- Loop Constructs:
    - Infinite loops using `loop`.
    - Conditional loops with `while`.
    - Iterative loops with `for`.
- Decision Making with `match`:
    - Like switch-case in other languages.
    - Handling various scenarios and patterns.

**5. Data Structures**
- Tuples and Arrays:
    - Fixed-size collections of values.
- Collections:
    - `Vec<T>`: A growable list of items.
    - `HashMap<K, V>`: Key-value storage.
        - Methods like `insert`, `get`, and iteration over keys/values.

**6. Custom Data Types and Methods**
- Structs:
    - Defining custom data types with `struct`.
    - Understanding fields and methods.
- `impl` Blocks:
    - Adding methods to structs.
    - Introduction to the `self` keyword.

**7. Memory Safety in Rust**
- Ownership:
    - A set of rules to manage memory.
- Borrowing:
    - Two types: Mutable and Immutable borrows.
- Lifetimes:
    - Ensuring references are valid for as long as they're used.

**8. Error Handling**
- Understanding `Option` and `Result`:
    - How Rust handles the absence of a value or possible errors.
- The `unwrap` method:
    - Quick and dirty error handling.
    - Dangers of panicking.
- Using `match` for Error Handling:
    - Gracefully handling potential errors without crashing.

**9. External Libraries and Advanced Features**
- Using Crates:
    - What are crates?
    - The `extern crate` declaration.
- Advanced Features in Action:
    - Introduction to the `rand` crate.
    - Generating random numbers and strings.

**10. Bringing it All Together: The Password Manager**
- Reviewing the password manager code.
- Tracing through each function and method.
- Understanding the flow and logic behind each decision.
